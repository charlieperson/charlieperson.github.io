Restricted Data Structures- restrict you to it's interface.

An API? Application Program Interface- how you interact with something.
Implementation is not seen by the user (wires, batteries in phone)

Stack (LIFO - FILO)

Standard interface: push pop sometimes(peek)

Queue (FIFO - LILO)
Line at a restaurant.
Standard interface:

    -Dequeue - get served and get out of line (array.shift)
