### This is my tech blog.

#### Purpose: Solidify my learnings one post at a time. This is a very personal blog, for the purpose of sitting down at the end of a day, and defining what I actually learned that day. There are too many times when I pack so much into my brain during a day, go to sleep, and not be sure what I know and what I don't. This will serve as a way to find out what I truly know, and where the gaps are in my knowledge.
