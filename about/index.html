    <p class="about_me">
      My name is Charlie. I'm a software engineer at ThoughtWorks. This is my personal
      tech blog. As a programmer, I must constantly be learning new things and keeping
      up with the industry. There's just so much information out there, and it can
      feel like trying to drink water from a fire hose. Therefore, I find it important
      to document my learnings so that I can know what I actually know, and discover where
      the gaps are in my knowledge.
