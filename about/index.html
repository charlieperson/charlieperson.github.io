    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h4>
      My name is Charlie. I decided to learn how to code about two years ago.
      Initially, the idea was to just get a general idea about code, and be able to
      communicate effectvely with developers. Then, I started learning, got hooked,
      couldn't let it go, and here I am. Writing blog posts about instantion patterns
      and data structures. <br><br> If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to
