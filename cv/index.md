## Education

#### [MakerSquare]
###### Austin, Texas &emsp; August 2016 - December 2016
Four months of non-stop everything JavaScript. The curriculum consists of both front-end, and back-end technologies. Front-end tech consists of Native Javascript, Angular, Backbone, React, D3, and JQuery. Back-end tech consists of Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, and Bookshelf. Pair programming is a pillar at this school. I am able to refine this skill everyday to maximize learning, and practice working with others to solve problems.

#### [Maker’s Academy]
###### London, England &emsp; October 2015 - March 2016
A sixteen week highly selective web development bootcamp. The curriculum consists of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and whatever else is needed to get the job done. We were taught best practices from the beginning. We learned the importance of always test driving development, keeping code DRY, pair programming, the escalation process, and the single responsibility principle. This is where I fell in love with code.

#### [Hyper Island Digital Media Creative]
###### Stockholm, Sweden &emsp; August 2014 - June 2016
A digital media school focused on group dynamics, and how to best utilize talent among team members. Digital Media Creative is a two year immersive learning journey exploring topics from design to technology, and strategy to project management. I got the privilege to present to companies like IKEA and Hugo Boss. This school is where I found myself.
