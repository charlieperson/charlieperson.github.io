###### Austin, Texas &emsp; August 2016 - December 2016
Four months of non-stop everything JavaScript. The curriculum consists of both front-end, and back-end technologies. Front-end tech consists of Native Javascript, Angular, Backbone, React, D3, and JQuery. Back-end tech consists of Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, and Bookshelf. Pair programming is a pillar at this school. I am able to refine this skill everyday to maximize learning, and practice working with others to solve problems.

A sixteen week highly selective web development bootcamp. The curriculum consists of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and whatever else is needed to get the job done. We were taught best practices from the beginning. We learned the importance of always test driving development, keeping code DRY, pair programming, the escalation process, and the single responsibility principle. This is where I fell in love with code.
