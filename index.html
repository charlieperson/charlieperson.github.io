		<h1>Hi there, I'm Charlie Person!</h1>
		<p>
			I am attending Hack Reactor in Austin, Texas. It's a sixteen week
			software engineering bootcamp that specializes in JavaScript. This is the
			second bootcamp I have attended. I've learned that during these high
			intensity programs, it can feel like trying to drink knowledge from a
			fire hose. When I pack tons of information into my head in a short
			amount of time, it's difficult to be sure of what is actually sticking,
			and what isn't. To help with this, I will attempt to write one blog post
			everyday to solidify my learnings from that day, as well as help find,
			and be more aware of the gaps in my knowledge.
