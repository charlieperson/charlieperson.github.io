				<h2>Hi there, I'm Charlie Person!</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Charlie. I'm a software engineer at ThoughtWorks. This is my personal
		      tech blog. As a programmer, I must constantly be learning new things and keeping
		      up with the industry. There's just so much information out there, and it can
		      feel like trying to drink water from a fire hose. Therefore, I find it important
		      to document my learnings so that I can know what I actually know, and discover where
		      the gaps are in my knowledge.
