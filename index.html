				<h2>Hi there, I'm Charlie Person!</h2>
				<p>
					I am attending Hack Reactor in Austin, Texas. It's a
					software engineering JavaScript bootcamp. During high
					intensity programs, it can feel like trying to drink knowledge from a
					fire hose, and it's difficult to be sure of what is actually sticking.
					To help with this, I will create blog posts to solidify my learnings,
					and be more aware of the gaps in my knowledge.
