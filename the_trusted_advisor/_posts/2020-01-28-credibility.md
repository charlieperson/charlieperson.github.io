Credibility largely comes down to not only experience, but more importantly how
that experience has lead to favorable outcomes of previous clients and projects.
this is especially difficult for a consultancy just starting out, which is why the
first client is often times the most difficult to land. Why? Because at that point,
they don't have the credibility or the track record that proves that they can add
value. Now, the reason that it is "often times" the most difficult client to land,
and not ALWAYS the most difficult is due to the fact that if the project is not
a success then it makes the next client that much harder to land.

It's very much like someone who hasn't established any credit. Banks are very hesitant to give a loan to
someone without credit because they don't have proof that the person can pay back
the debt, which is why interest rates are so high- a vicious cycle, but that's life.
However, if the bank does grant the person a loan, and that individual does not
pay their bills on time, the next loan will be even more difficult to justify, because
at that point, the person has established credit- but the wrong kind. They've established
poor credit and based on that track record, no credit is easier to bet on then bad
credit. This is why it is as a consultancy it is even more crucial to have an abundance
of success stories early on.

For individual people, financial experts encourage to
take larger risks early in life and become more conservative as life progresses.
For a young consultancy however, this rule is actually inversely in effect
It is important to manage risk most closely at the beginning to set up a positive track record.
to establish credibility. Focus on what you know and gain experience, learn from
successful initiatives and pay attention to other areas that may be opportunities
of growth in the future.

Credibility is a difficult predicament because, also much like credit, you need it in order
to get more of it. Therefore, early customers have to take much more of a risk going
with a consultancy that has not established credibility. Therefore, as a young consultancy,
they must incentivize this risk by working for cheap. There is a direct correlation between
how much credit a consultancy has, and how much of a premium they can charge for their
services.
