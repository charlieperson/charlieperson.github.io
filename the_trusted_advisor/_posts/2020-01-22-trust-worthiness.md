Trust worthiness is the most important component that a consultant is the most
important factor in a relationship with a client and a consultant. It may seem
that this is an obvious law, given the fact that a client reaches out to a
consultancy for a specialty service to help them develop in areas of which they
are lacking. Therefore, it is integral that the client trusts in our know-how,
aptitude and expertise.

### Boiling it down

David Maister, Charles Green & Robert Galford express in their book, The Trusted
Advisor, that this can actually be boiled down to an equation. The book lays out that
Trust Worthiness is equal to Credibility, Reliability, and Intimacy divided by
Self Orientation.

```
Trust Worthiness = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self Orientation
```

I will go into detail as to each component of this equation in
future posts, but holistically, trust worthiness is the key factor for any client/consultant
relationship. Now, it's important to make the distinction between trust, and
trust worthiness. Trust comes over time and has to be earned. Trust worthiness is
a more robust version of trust. Trust worthiness is not just a component of one
individual coming through consistently in a relationship, but rather trust worthiness
can be carried into other relationships that have not even been initiated.

### How? References.

Through referrals of trusted individuals who have experience
working with a consultancy and the consultants within it. Lets say I have a colleague
or business associate that I have worked with for years and trust dearly. If this
person has had success with a consultancy and a pleasant experience working with
them, I am far more likely to put my faith in them. They have not established any
trust directly with the client (yet), but through successful ventures with people,
and even competitors, in the same or closely related industry, that trust can
actually carry over.

So, if favorable references are the best way to grow a consultancy, how do we go
about collecting these little pearls? Well, that's where the equation comes into
play- READ ON!
