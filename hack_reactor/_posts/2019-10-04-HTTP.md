#### GET REQUESTS

Ahhhh- the GET request. The language of the internet. What is it? Well, honestly
it's just a bunch of text being sent from clients to servers and vis versa. The way that
this text is being sent around is via REQUESTS and RESPONSES. A client will make a
request to a server, which will then serve that client a response.


All requests consists of two things:
- An end Point:
  - which also consists of two things:
    - a method - Usually GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, or DELETE
    - a URL: This is where we specify our desired path for our request. e.g. ```/download```

  - Headers
    Request headers consist of one or more key-value pairs. E.g. HOST: jquery.com

This is the bare minimum ingredients needed to make a successful HTTP
GET request.

The actual request would look like this:

```
GET /download HTTP/1.1
Host: jquery.com
```
