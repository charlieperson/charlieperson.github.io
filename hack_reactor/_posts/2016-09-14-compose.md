Composing functions together is the concept of 'melding' or combining functions
together.

So- we could make a function:

```
function upperEveryOther(string){
  var splitIt = string.split('');
  for(var i=0; i<splitIt.length; i++) {
  	if(i%2===0) splitIt[i] = splitIt[i].toUpperCase();
  }
  return splitIt.join('')
}
```

This function accepts a string, and returns a string with every other character
capitalized. Now consider this function:

```
function addBanana(string){
	return string + 'banana ';
}
```

This function also accepts a string, and simply returns a new string with 'banana'
added to the end. Pretty straightforward.

```
function compose(func1, func2) {
	return function(input){
		return func2(func1(input))
	}
}
```
This will be our composition function. It receives two functions and returns
another function that takes an input and feeds that input through both functions.
However- order matters, meaning once func1 is run with the input first, and then
func2 is run with the return value of func1(input).


Here's an example that illustrates this:
```
var addBananaFirst = compose(addBanana, upperEveryOther);
```
This returns a function that takes one argument. What do you think will be logged to the console?
```
console.log(addBananaFirst('Hello World'));
```
This will log ```HeLlO WoRlD BaNaNa```. Notice that every other character in 'banana'
is capitalized.

Now let's compare that example with this one:
```
var UpperEveryOtherFirst = compose(upperEveryOther, addBanana)
```
This returns a function with func1 bound to upperEveryOther and func2 bound to
addBanana. When we run it:
```
console.log(UpperEveryOtherFirst('Hello World'));
```
The input is first fed into the call to upperEveryOther and the return value of that
call is given to the call to addBanana. Therefore ```HeLlO WoRlD banana``` will be logged.
