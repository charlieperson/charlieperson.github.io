What is a closure?

While there are tons of different resources on the web suggesting what defines a
closure, there is one thing in common with every definition. It is that at some point, there
is a function that accesses a variable outside of its own scope. And that is
all a closure really is. It's a very simple concept, but that does not mean that it is
at all an easy one, and is one of the most common causes of bugs.

A closure in its simplest form would look something like this:

```
var x = 20;

function closure() {
  return x;
}
```
It is important to note that a closure does not have anything to do with execution
context, and everything to do with lexical scope. In other words, the number of
closures in a piece of code can be determined just by looking at it before it ever runs.
